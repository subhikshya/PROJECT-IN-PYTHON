                Here is the write your game rules.The Water Sort Puzzle is a popular mobile game where players are presented with containers filled with colored liquids and the objective is to sort the liquids into a predetermined arrangement using a limited number of moves. Here are the basic rules of the game:
                Initial Setup: At the beginning of each level, the player is presented with several containers, each containing a mixture of colored liquids. The number of containers and the colors of liquids vary from level to level.
                Sorting Objective: The objective of each level is to sort the liquids from the initial mixed state into a final state where each container contains only one color of liquid.
                Moving Liquids: The player can move the liquids between containers by pouring them. However, there are limitations on how the liquids can be poured.
                The player can pour liquid from one container to another only if both containers have enough space to accommodate the poured liquid.
                The player can pour liquid from the top of one container into another container as long as the poured liquid forms a contiguous block of the same color.
                Limited Moves: Players have a limited number of moves or pours to achieve the sorting objective. The number of moves allowed varies from level to level
                Constraints: Some levels may include additional constraints or challenges, such as:Limited space in containers, requiring strategic planning to prevent overflow.
                Limited capacity for certain colors, meaning some containers cannot hold certain colors of liquid.Obstacles or barriers that restrict the flow of liquids between containers.Completing Levels: The player successfully completes a level when all containers are filled with only one color of liquid, and the sorting is achieved within the allowed number of moves.
                Scoring: Players may earn points or stars based on how efficiently they complete a level, such as completing it in fewer moves or within a shorter time limit.Progression: As players complete levels, they unlock new, more challenging levels with different arrangements of containers, colors of liquids, and additional obstacles.
